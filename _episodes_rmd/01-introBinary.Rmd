> ## Exercise  
> You have been asked to study physical activity (`PhysActive`) 
> in individuals with an FEV1 (`FEV1`) between 3750 and 4250 in the NHANES data. 
> Calculate the odds and the log odds of physical activity
> for individuals with an FEV1 between 3750 and 4250. 
> How is the odds interpreted here?
>
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > ```{r odds and log odds PhysActive_FEV1}
> > dat %>%
> >   drop_na(PhysActive) %>%
> >   filter(between(FEV1, 3750, 4250)) %>%
> >   count(PhysActive) %>%
> >   mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
> >   filter(PhysActive == "Yes") %>%
> >   summarise(odds = prop/(1-prop),
> >     log_odds = log(prop/(1-prop)))
> > ```
> > 
> > Since the odds equal 2.17, we expect individuals with an FEV1 between 3750
> > and 4250 to be 2.17 times more likely to be physically active than not.
