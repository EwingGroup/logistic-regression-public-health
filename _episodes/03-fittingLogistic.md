In this episode we will learn to fit a logistic regression model when we have one binary response variable and one continuous explanatory variable. Before we fit the model, we can explore the relationship between our variables graphically. We are checking whether, on average, observations split along the binary variable appear to differ in the explanatory variable.

Let us take response variable `SmokeNow` and the continuous explanatory variable `Age` as an example. For participants that have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their life, `SmokeNow` denotes whether they still smoke. The code below drops NAs in the response variable. The plotting is then initiated using `ggplot()`. Inside `aes()`, we select the response variable with `y = SmokeNow` and the continuous explanatory variable with `x = Age`. Finally, violin plots are called using `geom_violin()`.

The plot suggests that on average, participants of younger age are still smoking and participants of older age have given up smoking. We can now proceed with fitting the logistic regression model.

We fit the model using `glm()`. As with the `lm()` command, we specify our response and explanatory variables with `formula = SmokeNow ~ Age`. In addition, we specify `family = "binomial"` so that a logistic regression model is fit by `glm()`.  


~~~
SmokeNow_Age <- dat %>%
  glm(formula = SmokeNow ~ Age, family = "binomial")

summ(SmokeNow_Age, exp = TRUE)

The logistic regression model equation associated with this model has the general form:

$$\text{logit}(E(y)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x_1.$$

Recall that $\beta_0$ estimates the log odds when $x_1 = 0$ and $\beta_1$ estimates the difference in the log odds associated with a one-unit difference in $x_1$. Using `summ()`, we can obtain estimates for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$:

summ(SmokeNow_Age, digits = 3)

The equation therefore becomes:

$$\text{logit}(E(\text{PhysActive})) = 2.607 - 0.054 \times \text{Age}.$$

Alternatively, we can express the model equation in terms of the probability of "success": 

$$\text{Pr}(y = 1) = \text{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x_1).$$

In this example, $\text{SmokeNow} = \text{Yes}$ is "success". The equation therefore becomes:

$$\text{Pr}(\text{SmokeNow} = \text{Yes}) = \text{logit}^{-1}(2.607 - 0.054 \times \text{Age}).$$

Finally, we can visualise our model using the `effect_plot()` function from the `jtools` 
package. Importantly, logistic regression models are often visualised in terms of 
the probability of success, i.e. $\text{Pr}(\text{SmokeNow} = \text{Yes})$ in our example.

We specify our model inside `effect_plot()`, alongside our explanatory variable of interest
with `pred = Age`. To aid interpretation of the model, we include the original data points
with `plot.points = TRUE`. Recall that our data is binary, so the data points are exclusively
$0$s and $1$s. To avoid overlapping points becoming hard to interpret, we add jitter using
`jitter = c(0.1, 0.05)` and opacity using `point.alpha = 0.1`. 


~~~
effect_plot(SmokeNow_Age, pred = Age, plot.points = TRUE,
            jitter = c(0.1, 0.05), point.alpha = 0.1)
